#### Short for _iMessage Text Animation_ ðŸ’¬

This will animate the text like apple does in iMessages.
Woohooooo!

Apple iMessages have some cool animation for text
![iMessage One](assets/one.gif)
![iMessage One](assets/two.gif)
like these.

So I thought of making it happen in html (css & js too ofc.)

I've came a this far -
![iMessage One](assets/last.gif)
And there's a long way to go!

Currently using [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) as the animation engine.
